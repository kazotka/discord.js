# discord.js
The discord.js project realized in javascripth is a discord bot realized with the discord api, discordAPI.For the moment this project is under development so some features will not be available immediately, but for the moment the necessary is present I specify take the time to read the following file that explains how to use the bot properly.

## How it works?
It's simple, first make sure you have the necessary development tools, whether it's your vs.code or encroe nodejs, as well as the site allowing the realization of your application. [This website](discordjs.guide/preparations/) and [this website too.](code.visualstudio.com)
Then when all is good create a terminal and enter the following command ''npm i'' after this done I let you use this template to improve yourself and if you want to improve yourself I advise you [this site](discordjs.guide).
